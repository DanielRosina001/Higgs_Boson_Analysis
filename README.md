# Higgs Boson Analysis
Contains code that was used in the submission for the Higgs Boson competition, which used analysis to perform predictions to identify the Higgs Boson through various models and optimization techniques. 

The competition details can be found in the kaggle competition [Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/higgs-boson/). Training and testing datasets, as well as example submissions can be found and downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/higgs-boson/data). 

# Summary
Employed the use of various models to improve overall score. Mainly used the Random Forest algorithm, and used optimization techniques such as GridSearchCV and PCA decomposition to improve accuracy.
